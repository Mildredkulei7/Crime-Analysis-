## Description
We can define crime as the intentional commission of an act usually deemed socially harmful or dangerous and specifically defined, prohibited, and punishable under criminal law. There is a high rate of crime in all regions of Kenya, particularly in Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa, and coastal beach resorts.
Kenya's criminal justice system is undeniably flawed. Kenyans regard it as corrupt and rotten because there are numerous cases that occurred years ago and yet justice has not been served. The crime rate continues to rise year after year as a result of crimes not being reported or being reported but the police not arriving at the crime scene on time. As a result, we'd like to learn more about what motivates crime in Kenya and the most common types of crime.
